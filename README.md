A web3.0 web app which sends ethereum via metamask via goerli test network.
I developed this with various new technologies like react js, solidity, tailwind css, vite, hardhat, alchemy, giphy.
After sending ethereum and after mentioning their is a gif attached to it and when we click it we can see all the transaction history.
